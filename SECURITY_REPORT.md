## Findings
- [HIGH] Upgrade js-yaml to v4.1.0+
  - Detected js-yaml@^3.14.1. Version 4+ makes safe parsing the default and removes unsafe APIs.
  - Recommendation: Bump to ^4.1.0 and re-run tests.
- [MODERATE] YAML parsing with js-yaml (src/utils.ts)
  - Ensure js-yaml v4+ is used so load() is safe by default.
  - Recommendation: Upgrade js-yaml to v4.1.0+.

## Fixes Applied
- Upgraded js-yaml to ^4.1.0
  - package.json updated

## Suggested Improvements
- Add a CI step to run `npm audit --audit-level=moderate` and fail on findings.
- Keep `js-yaml` at v4+ and avoid custom YAML tags unless necessary.
- Avoid dynamic code execution (`eval`, `new Function`).
- Validate and sanitize all external inputs before parsing.
- Enable Dependabot or Renovate for automated dependency updates.
